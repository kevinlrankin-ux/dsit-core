# IP Participation Addendum (Non-LE Deployments)

This document describes an **optional commercial participation** model for DSIT-based deployments.

## Summary
- **Law enforcement** use: **$0**
- **Non-commercial research / education**: **$0**
- **Commercial deployments**: IP participation **up to 5%** of revenue directly attributable to DSIT-enabled services.

## Note (implementation reality)
To enforce commercial participation, DSIT should be distributed under a **commercial license** for commercial use and a free license for LE/non-commercial use. This repo includes a community license draft; organizations may require legal review for adoption.
