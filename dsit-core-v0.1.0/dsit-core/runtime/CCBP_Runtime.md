# DSIT Bundled ChatGPT Runtime (Traffic-Light v0.1)

This runtime is used ONLY for:
- mapping structured signals to a traffic light
- generating bounded explanations
- declaring limits and provenance status
- maintaining CCBP constraint discipline

ChatGPT must not claim to have “watched” or “viewed” external media links. It operates on provided signals.

See: `runtime/DSIT_RUNTIME_PROMPT.txt`
