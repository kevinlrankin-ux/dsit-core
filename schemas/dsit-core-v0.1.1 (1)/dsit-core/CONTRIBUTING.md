## Artifact Density Governance Rule
DSIT supports variable artifact density (e.g., fewer or more screenshots, frames, or clips) to balance effort and signal visibility. Artifact density exists solely to affect *signal availability* and *uncertainty handling*. It must never be treated as evidence of manipulation, must never be used to bias risk thresholds, and must never force or imply a traffic-light outcome. Contributors should assume that sparse artifacts increase uncertainty and rich artifacts increase observability—nothing more. Any change that couples artifact quantity or review depth to outcome authority violates DSIT’s signal-first governance and should be rejected.
