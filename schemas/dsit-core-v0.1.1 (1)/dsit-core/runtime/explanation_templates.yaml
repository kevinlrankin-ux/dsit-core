video_lip_sync_drift:
  meaning: "Timing mismatch between speech sounds and mouth motion."
  caveats:
    - "Dubbed audio or ADR can look similar."
    - "Broadcast latency can introduce drift."
video_temporal_jitter:
  meaning: "Frame-to-frame instability in the face region."
  caveats:
    - "Stabilization artifacts can look similar."
    - "Rolling shutter and motion blur can increase jitter."
audio_vocoder_artifacts:
  meaning: "Spectral/phase patterns consistent with synthetic speech generation."
  caveats:
    - "Aggressive noise reduction can create artifacts."
image_freq_artifacts:
  meaning: "Frequency-domain patterns sometimes associated with synthesis or heavy upsampling."
  caveats:
    - "Strong JPEG compression can introduce similar patterns."
